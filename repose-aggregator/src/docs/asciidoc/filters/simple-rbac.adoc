= Simple Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Filter

The Simple Role Based Access Control (RBAC) filter provides a way to get API validation for services without the need to create a WADL.

The <<../recipes/role-based-access-control.adoc#,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)>> is achieved using a request header populated by an authentication filter.

== General filter information
* *Name:* simple-rbac
* *Default Configuration:* simple-rbac.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v7.1.2.0
* *Bundle:* repose-extensions-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/simple-rbac.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
In the original super simple legacy mode:

* `X-Roles` - A header containing the roles belonging to the user making the request.
  The name of the header containing said roles is configurable, but `X-Roles` is the default.

OR

In the newer multi-tenant mode:

* `X-Tenant-Id` - A header containing the Tenant ID's associated with the current request.
  The name of this header is configurable, but `X-Tenant-Id` is typically created by other filters.
* `X-Map-Roles` - Identifies the tenant-to-role mapping for all of the user's tenants and roles.
  This header is a base 64 encoded JSON map of strings to arrays of strings (e.g., the base 64 encoding of `{"someTenant": ["someRole", "sharedRole"], "otherTenant": ["otherRole", "sharedRole"]}`).
  Roles without a tenant association will be mapped to the `repose/domain/roles` key (e.g., `{"repose/domain/roles": ["tenantlessRole"]}`).

The most common use of a request header by this filter is for <<../recipes/role-based-access-control.adoc#,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)>> using the `X-Roles`, `X-Tenant-Id`, and/or `X-Map-Roles` headers populated by either the <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#,Keystone v2 filter>> or the <<../filters/keystone-v2-authorization.adoc#,Keystone v2 Authorization filter>>.

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no dependencies on other filters and can be placed wherever it is needed in the filter chain.

However, due to the nature of this filter, it is typically placed early in the filter chain immediately after any authentication filters (e.g., <<keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 Filter>>).

=== Request Headers Created
* `X-Relevant-Roles` - Lists the values of the `X-Roles` (or a semantically equivalent) header which match a role value from the configuration for the resource being requested.
In other words, `X-Relevant-Roles` are the user roles which granted access to the resource.
* `X-Delegated` - Provides details about the failure being delegated by this filter.
This is mainly intended for use by the <<herp.adoc#, Highly Efficient Record Processor (HERP) filter>> and <<derp.adoc#, Delegation Response Processor (DeRP) filter>> for internal delegation processing within *Repose*.
However, it can be exposed to the origin service under certain configurations.
This header is only added if delegation is enabled.

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not strictly required by any other filters.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes
[cols="2", options="header,autowidth"]
.Status Codes
|===
| Status Code
| Reasons
| `403`
| A requested resource or method requires a specific `X-Roles` request header value that was not found.

| `404`
| The filter determined that the URI is invalid.

  When `mask-rax-roles-403` attribute is enabled (i.e., `true`), this could also indicate the supplied `X-Roles` request header value did not have access to the URI.

| `405`
| The URI is valid, but the Method is not appropriate for the URI.

  When `mask-rax-roles-403` attribute is enabled (i.e., `true`), this could also indicate the supplied `X-Roles` request header value had access to the URI, but not the requested Method.

== Examples
=== Basic Example
This configuration is a basic example that exhibits a common use-case.

[source,xml]
.simple-rbac.cfg.xml
----

<simple-rbac xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/simple-rbac/v1.0">
    <resources> <!--1-->
/path/to/this   GET     role1,role2,role3,role4
/path/to/this   PUT     role1,role2,role3
/path/to/this   POST    role1,role2
/path/to/this   DELETE  role1
/path/to/that   GET,PUT ALL
/path/to/that   ALL     role1
/path/{to}/wild GET     role1
    </resources>
</simple-rbac>
----
<1> Defines the available resources.
Resources are listed one per line in the `<PATH> <METHODS> <ROLES>` format.
That is, each line should present the path to the resource, a series of spaces, the methods available on the resource, a series of spaces, and the roles which grant access to the resource.
If a resource is not listed, requests to that resource will be rejected.

[NOTE]
====
While roles are allowed to have spaces in the names, any additional leading and trailing whitespace around the comma separators is removed.
That is to say a role can NOT start or end with a space.
====

[NOTE]
====
`ANY` and `ALL` act as special wildcards for both HTTP methods and roles.
When used for HTTP methods it is shorthand for the four basic REST methods (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE`).

=== Full Example with External Resources File
This configuration is a full example that uses every possible configuration item.
It does not, however, cover the resources format, as including resources both inline and via the `href` attribute will cause only the inline resources to be used.

----
<1> Specifies the name of the header which contains the list of user roles. +
    Default: `X-Roles`
<2> Specifies the name of the header which contains the list of user tenants. +
    Default: `NONE`
<3> If set to true, instead of returning a FORBIDDEN (403), the response will be a NOT FOUND (404) if no methods are accessible or a METHOD NOT ALLOWED (405) if some methods are available. +
    Default: `false`
<4> If set to true, this filter will record, via JMX, the number of times each state in the generated state machine (the underlying mechanism) is accessed.
    These values may be used to determine API usage and coverage.
    The path taken by each request is also logged to the named `api-coverage-logger` logger in the Log4J configuration.
    If that logger is not configured, then they are logged to the default handler. +
    Default: `false`
<5> Specifies the DOT output file for this validator.
    DOT is a plain text graph description language.
    This is a simple way of describing graphs that both humans and computer programs can use..
<6> Specifies the Web Application Description Language (WADL) output file for this validator.
    This is a way of describing the API of a Web Application that both humans and computer programs can use.
<7> Inclusion of this element prevents this filter from returning errors, and directs this filter to populate delegation headers instead.
<8> Specifies the quality of specific output headers.
    When setting up a chain of delegating filters, the highest quality number will be the one that is eventually output. +
    Default: `0.3`
<9> The component name used in the delegation header.
    This is particularly useful when multiple instances of an API-Checker based filter are used in the same filter chain. +
    Default: `simple-rbac`
<10> Specifies a location to an external file which contains the Simple RBAC resources.
    If the message element has a value and the `href` attribute is configured, the Simple RBAC will use what is configured in the value.
    If the file that the `href` attribute points to is modified, the Simple RBAC will not reload the configuration.
    So the new RBAC file should be placed in a new file name (e.g., Dated) and the simple-rbac.cfg.xml file updated to point to it in order to guarantee the changes are utilized.

== Additional Information

=== Delegation
In some cases, you may want to delegate the validation of a request down the chain to either another filter or to the origin service.
Delegation prevents the Simple RBAC filter from failing the request by forwarding the request with the `X-Delegated` header that is set with a value which indicates how the filter would have failed if not in delegating mode.

To place the filter in delegating mode, add the `delegating` element to the filter configuration with a quality that determines the delegation priority.

The format for the `X-Delegated` header value is `status_code={status-code}`component={filter-name}`message={failure message};q={delegating-quality}`.
