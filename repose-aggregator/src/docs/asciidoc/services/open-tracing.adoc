= OpenTracing Service

The OpenTracing service, which adheres to the http://opentracing.io[OpenTracing standard], enables reporting of tracing data to a collection service.

The initial release of the OpenTracing service only supports using the http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Jaeger client library].
However, other Tracers can be integrated in future OpenTracing service updates.
By default, the service is disabled, but it can be enabled by including an `open-tracing.cfg.xml` configuration.
The origin service can simply pass the Tracer-specific header to downstream services and requests will be traced across application boundaries.

[NOTE]
====
For backwards compatibility with the underlying configuration mechanism, the only way to disable the OpenTracing service after it has been started is to restart the *Respose* instance.

== OpenTracing implementation detail

This section will cover all Tracers that are supported by the OpenTracing service.
We will be adding to this list as more tracers are supported.

Current support:

== Examples
=== Basic Configuration
This configuration will send all traces to the collector at `http://localhost:14268`.

<1> The required name of the service that is reporting traces.
    This value will be used to identify the service and should therefore be unique (e.g., identity-repose).
<2> Defines the Tracer implementation to use as Jaeger.
<3> Indicates to use HTTP communication with the default Collector endpoint at `http://localhost:14268`.
<4> Collector endpoint.
<5> Indicates to use the Constant (`const`) sampling scheme with the default of `on` which means all.

=== Use Basic Auth with the Collector endpoint
This configuration will send one of every 1,000 traces to the collector using Basic HTTP Authentication.

<1> The required name of the service that is reporting traces.
    This value will be used to identify the service and should therefore be unique (e.g., identity-repose).
<2> How often to send span data to tracer in milliseconds. +
    Default: `1000`
<3> Maximum number of spans in buffer before sending. +
    Default: `10,000`
<4> Optionally sets up a logger for all spans. +
    Default: `true`
<5> Collector endpoint.
<6> Optional username sent for Basic HTTP Authentication as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[RFC 7617].
<7> Optional password sent for Basic HTTP Authentication as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[RFC 7617].
+
[NOTE]
====
The `username` attribute must be accompanied by a `password` attribute.
The `token` attribute is mutually exclusive to the `username`/`password` attributes.
====

<8> The Probability (`probability`) sampling scheme applies a probabilistic algorithm weighted between `0.0` and `1.0`.
    With `0.0` being None and `1.0` being All. +
    Default: `0.001`

=== Broadcast to the Collector endpoint
This configuration will send at most one trace per second to the collector using UDP.

    Default: `1.0`
